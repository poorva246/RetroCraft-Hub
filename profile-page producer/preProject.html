                <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical 
                  Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                  College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going 
                  through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1
                  .10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book
                   is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
